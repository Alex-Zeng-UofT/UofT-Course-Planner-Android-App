> **CSCB07H3** Software Design &nbsp; | &nbsp; Fall 2022 &nbsp; | &nbsp; **Project Grade:** &nbsp; 96% 

An Android mobile app developed adopting a _Scrum/Agile_ life cycle, using _Java_, _Firebase_, and _Android Studio_. Students can manage taken courses by adding and removing to a database containing completed courses. By providing a list of desire courses to take, a smart algorithm generates a timeline of the sequence to follow, computing from courses' prerequisites, offering sessions, and taken courses. Admins can manage course information such creating, editing, and deleting courses through their interface.
